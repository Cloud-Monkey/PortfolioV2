                I am a junior developer who has worked on projects, and with tech such as React, React Native and Express. My current goal is becoming a full-time software engineer. I am constantly expanding my knowledge and my skills, working with different languages and frameworks. I also have strong soft skills such as communication. I am seeking a role that will allow me to apply my skills and passion whilst developing professionally. I enjoy collaborative environments and working within teams to bring ideas to life.
