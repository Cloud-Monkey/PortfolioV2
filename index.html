            <h3>Junior FullStack Developer</h3>
            <p>
                I am a junior developer who has worked with tech such as React, React Native and Express. My current goal is to become a full-time software engineer. I am constantly expanding my knowledge of tech, and my skillset, working with different languages and frameworks. I also have strong soft skills such as communication. I am seeking a role that will allow me to apply my skills. I enjoy collaborative environments and working within teams to bring ideas to life.
