          Parking app where the user can pin their location, take a picture and
          leave a note to help them remember where they parked. They can also
          view the pin on the map in comparison to where they are located, with
          directions, the note and the picture they took. This was a team
          project utilising kanban, daily stand-ups, wireframes and pair
          programming. On this project I used; React Native, Expo Go, Google
          Firebase, Google Firestore, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

          Review site to allow users to review tabletop games and leave
          comments. Users can also vote on reviews if they find them helpful or
          unhelpful and leave comments if they wish to highlight something
          missed. I utilised my knowledge of kanban when creating this project,
          via Trello, and made it robust by adding testing throughout.
